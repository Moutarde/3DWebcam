Details
----------

This program uses the following libraries :
	- OpenCV 2.2	-> http://opencv.org/
	- Qt 4.8.1		-> http://qt.nokia.com/
	- blImageAPI	-> http://www.barbato.us/
	- SFML			-> http://www.sfml-dev.org/
	- Boost			-> http://www.boost.org/
	- PThread


--------------------
Visual Studio 2010
--------------------

You have to install the above libraries in the 3DWebcam folder in order to compilate the Visual Studio solution.
The libraries folders should be placed into the following folders :
	- 3DWebcam/OpenCV2.2	->	bin, include and lib
	- 3DWebcam/Qt/4.8.1		->	bin, include, lib, mkspecs and src
	- 3DWebcam/boost		->	only the smart_ptr "header-only" library and the other boost headers it needs to work
	- 3DWebcam/PThread		->	include and lib
Or you can install the libraries where you want and redo the linking yourself...

The blImageAPI and SFML libraries are included in the git repository.
In fact, blImageAPI is very light and has been slightly modified to work with this project,
and we only need a small part of SFML (the Thread library).

Finally, copy the following .dll files in Release and Debug folders :
	- pthreadVCE2.dll
	- QtCore4.dll
	- QtGui4.dll
Or you can copy those files in your system folder...
