This software is a 3D video communication application.
As other softwares as Skype, it allows to communicate with other people threw internet, but there you can see in 3D.

----------
Details
----------

This program uses the following libraries :
	- OpenCV 2.2	-> http://opencv.org/
	- Qt 4.8.1		-> http://qt.nokia.com/
	- JMVC
	- blImageAPI	-> http://www.barbato.us/
	- SFML			-> http://www.sfml-dev.org/
	- Boost			-> http://www.boost.org/
	- PThread		-> http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/

The JMVC, blImageAPI and SFML libraries are included in the git repository.
In fact, blImageAPI is very light and has been slightly modified to work with this project,
and we only need a small part of SFML (the Thread library).
Moreover, JMVC is hard to find, so it's included in this repository.
You will find the copyright, the changes note and the manual in the 3DWebcam/jmvc folder.


--------------------
Visual Studio 2010
--------------------

You have to install the above libraries in the 3DWebcam folder in order to compilate the Visual Studio solution.
The libraries folders should be placed into the following folders :
	- ExternLibraries/OpenCV2.2	->	bin, include and lib
	- ExternLibraries/Qt/4.8.1	->	bin, include, lib, mkspecs and src
	- ExternLibraries/boost		->	only the smart_ptr "header-only" library and the other boost headers it needs to work
	- ExternLibraries/PThread	->	include and lib
Or you can install the libraries where you want and redo the linking yourself...

Finally, copy the following .dll files in Release and Debug folders :
	- opencv_calib3d220d.dll
	- opencv_core220d.dll
	- opencv_highgui220d.dll
	- opencv_imgproc220d.dll
	- QtCore4.dll
	- QtGui4.dll
	- QtNetwork4.dll
	- pthreadVCE2.dll (apparently not necessary on Windows)
Or you can copy those files in your system folder...

Note that if you want to distribute the .exe file, you will need to include the following .dll,
as people who don't have Visual Studio on their computer won't have them :
	- msvcp100.dll
	- msvcp100d.dll
	- msvcr100.dll
	- msvcr100d.dll
	- vcomp100.dll


-----------------
Other compilers
-----------------

You will certainly need the libraries named before.
Install them on your computer and do the linking with you compiler.
You will also need to create a .pro file for Qt.
